## Overview
This project provides a visualization of amino acid data, where each data point is
associated with a specific energy value.
A **color-coded plot** is generated, assigning a unique color to each amino acid. This
makes it easy to observe and analyze how the energy distribution varies across
different amino acids.

## Features
- Visualizes amino acidâ€“energy relationships.
- Assigns each amino acid a distinct color for clarity.
- Displays energy distribution in a clear and interpretable way.
- Provides an intuitive visualization for further analysis.

## Visualization
The output plot shows the distribution of energies, where:
- Each point corresponds to an amino acid.
- Each amino acid is represented by a unique color.
- Patterns of energy distribution can be compared visually.
